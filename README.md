# Simplex-Method-Python-example
This is my project MAO302 Course make by FPT University. I use python code to slove some Linear Programming Problem.
# Part 1: Simplex Method for Linear Program (LP)
* Generate input matrices of a standard linear program in matrix from
* Write a code to solve the generated LP using to phase simplex method in matrix form
* Solve the genarated LP by a tool such as CVX, Cplex, ...
* Repeat (1)-(3) one hundred timnes and compare the mean and standard deviation of running time of your code with those of the chosen tool.
# Part 2: Game theory
Slove example: Players A and B each pick a number between 1 and 100. The game is a draw if both players pick the same number. Otherwise, the player who picks the smaller number wins unless that smaller number is one less than the opponentâ€™s number, in which case the opponent wins. Find the optimal strategy for this game.
# Part 3: Integer Programming (Branch-and-Bound)
* Generate input matrices of a standard linear program in matrix from (generate interger matrix)
* Write a code to solve the Branch-and-Bound.
* Solve the generated LP by a tool such as CVX, Cplex, ... to check your code. (slove by [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/))
* Repeat (1)-(3) one hundred timnes and compare the mean and standard deviation of running time of your code with those of the chosen tool.
